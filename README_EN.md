## Why Fitness Plan

Your fitness log should stay on your own device.

It turns body stats into a daily calorie and macro budget, logs meals from a local food database, and keeps weight and training beside them. No account. No cloud.

## ✦ What it does

### Eat

Mifflin–St Jeor produces BMR, TDEE, and protein, carbs, and fat. The built-in library has 637 common Mainland China foods in 18 categories, with 10 nutrients per 100 g. Logging a meal spends today's budget. Water is recorded on the same day.

### Train

An exercise library, training plans, and sets. What you do today stays on the device.

### Progress

A weight chart, body-fat percentage, and a hint when recent weigh-ins barely move. Steps come from Health Connect or HealthKit. On Android, a missing permission falls back to the phone sensor.

### Cultivate

While cutting, the running calorie deficit becomes a realm, not only a shrinking number.

## ⚔️ Cultivation

Cutting should not feel like a spreadsheet.

<p align="center">
  <strong>7,700 kcal → 1 kg</strong>
  <br><br>
  Qi Refining<br>
  ↓<br>
  Foundation<br>
  ↓<br>
  Core Formation<br>
  ↓<br>
  Nascent Soul<br>
  ↓<br>
  Divine Transformation
</p>

This path is complete only for the cut goal. Bulk and maintain can open the screen; the content is still a placeholder. A day marked as a cheat meal or a rest day leaves that day's calories out of cultivation.

Balanced days, carb cycling, and carb tapering each set a target for the day. The numbers are self-service estimates for generally healthy adults, not a clinical prescription.

## 🔒 Your data stays yours

<div align="center">

Drift → SQLite

No account · No cloud · No tracking

</div>

Meals, weight, workouts, and preferences stay on the device. You can export a backup and import it again. Workout, water, meal, and weigh-in reminders are each their own. The interface is Chinese and English, in a light theme and a graphite theme.

## 🚀 Get started

### Android

Download an APK from [Releases](https://github.com/DayDaySpeed/FitnessPlan/releases). Most phones want `FitnessPlan-*-android-arm64-v8a.apk`.

### Source

You need [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) matching the Dart SDK constraint `^3.12.2` in `pubspec.yaml`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DayDaySpeed/FitnessPlan.git
cd FitnessPlan
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

On first launch, enter sex, age, height, weight, activity, and a goal: cut, maintain, or bulk.

## Architecture

Calorie math, fat-loss strategies, plateau detection, and cultivation progress live in `lib/domain/`, with no Flutter imports. Screens talk to repositories through Riverpod. Repositories write to the database or to system services.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  UI["lib/ui<br/>Today · Foods · Records · Profile"] --> P["lib/providers"]
  UI --> D["lib/domain<br/>Calories · Strategy · Realm"]
  P --> D
  P --> R["lib/data<br/>repositories"]
  R --> DB[("Drift / SQLite")]
  R --> N["Steps · Notifications · App update"]
```

Android silently checks GitHub Releases on launch and when the app returns to the foreground. Desktop and web have no health store, so step sync is marked unsupported.

## Tech stack

- Flutter / Dart `^3.12.2`. Body text uses LXGW WenKai and Noto Sans SC
- flutter_riverpod `^3.3.2`
- go_router `^17.3.0`
- drift `^2.34.2`, on-device SQLite
- health `^13.3.1`, steps
- flutter_local_notifications `^22.0.1`
- fl_chart `^1.2.0`, weight charts

The bottom navigation and most screens use the ink icons in `assets/ink/`.

```

## Development

After changing a table:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

After editing [lib/l10n/app_zh.arb](lib/l10n/app_zh.arb) or the template [lib/l10n/app_en.arb](lib/l10n/app_en.arb), run `flutter gen-l10n`. `flutter pub get` generates as well.

After editing [assets/food_seed.json](assets/food_seed.json), bump `kFoodSeedVersion` (currently `13`) in [lib/data/repositories/food_repository.dart](lib/data/repositories/food_repository.dart) so existing installs re-sync.

Before a pull request:

```bash
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos
flutter test
```

A signed Android release (do not commit `key.properties` or `*.jks`):

```bash
./tool/build_release_apk.sh
```

See [android/key.properties.example](android/key.properties.example). iOS needs macOS and Xcode:

```bash
flutter build ipa --release
```

Releases here are Android APKs only. Linux emulator notes are in [docs/模拟器与运行说明.md](docs/模拟器与运行说明.md) (Chinese).

## Roadmap

- [x] Cut cultivation: Qi Refining → Foundation → Core Formation → Nascent Soul → Divine Transformation
- [x] Local meals, training, body logs, and Android releases
- [ ] Bulk and maintain cultivation (the entrance exists; the page is still a placeholder)

## Contributing

Match CI: `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` and `flutter test`. The workflow is [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Style is in [analysis_options.yaml](analysis_options.yaml).
